## This problem was asked by Palantir  202
## Daily Coding Problem, check if a certain integer is a pallindrome without converting to string..
## this was a kind of interesting one, obviously if we could convert to string its easy...
## when we consider the modulus operator , i


def checknum(num):
   temp = num
   rev = 0
   while (num >0):
      dec = num%10
      rev= rev * 10+dec
      num = (num-dec)/10
   if (rev==temp):
      print('pallindrone')
   else:
      print('not a pallindrone')
